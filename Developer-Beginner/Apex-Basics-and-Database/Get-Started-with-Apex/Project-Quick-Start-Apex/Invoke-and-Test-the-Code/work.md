# Salesforce -> Developer Beginner -> Apex Basics & Database -> Get Started with Apex -> Project: Quick Start: Apex -> Invoke and Test the Code

## Run the Code

An anonymous block is Apex code that does not get stored, but can be compiled and executed on demand right from the Developer Console. This is a great way to test your Apex Classes or run sample code.

1. In the Developer Console, select `Debug` | `Open Execute Anonymous Window`.
2. In the Enter Apex Code window, enter the following:

    ```js
    1. OlderAccountsUtility.updateOlderAccounts();
    ```

3. At the bottom right, click `Execute`.
