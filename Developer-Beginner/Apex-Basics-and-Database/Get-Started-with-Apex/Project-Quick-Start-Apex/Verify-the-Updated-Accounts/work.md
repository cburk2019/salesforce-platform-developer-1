2. Click the `Accounts` tab.
3. Click `Recently Viewed` to show the list of views, and then select `All Accounts`.

4. Click the `gear icon` and select `Select Fields to Display`. Move `Last Modified Date` to the Visible Fields column, and then click `Save`.

7. Look for the Description field. The value should be: `Heritage Account`
