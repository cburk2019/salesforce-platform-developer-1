## Before You Begin

We're excited to accompany you on your Apex adventure. While this module covers basic information about the programming language, it also goes deep, quickly. If this module is your first exposure to Apex, we highly recommend that you first go through the [Quick Start: Apex](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quickstart-apex) project. ([Here is the link to the project folder in this repo](/Developer-Beginner/Apex-Basics-and-Database/Get-Started-with-Apex/Project-Quick-Start-Apex/README.md)) Then come on back, we'll be waiting for you!
