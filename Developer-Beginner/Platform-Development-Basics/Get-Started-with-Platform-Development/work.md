## Get Started with Platform Development

### Learning Objectives

### Meet the Salesforce Platform

SF (Salesforce) groups their services by "clouds". There is Sales Cloud for CRM (Customer Relationship Management), Service Cloud for customer support, and a handful of other clouds that help companies support their business functions.

While each cloud serves their own unique purpose, they all have one thing in common --> the Salesforce platform.

What is the Salesforce platform?

- group of technologies that support the development of other technologies on top of it
- supports all Salesforce clouds
  - also supports custom functionality built by customers and partners, as well
  - functionality includes simple page layouts all the way up to full-scale applications

## Platform Building Blocks

Not only core SF products like Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, but also your own functionality. Building your onw functionality can means customizing existing SF offerings or building from scratch.

### What does SF offer developers?

Core platform lets you develop custom data models and apps for desktop and mobile. With the platform behind your development, ability to build robust systems can be done at a rapid pace.

### Heroku

SF uses Heroku! Heroku gives developers the power to build highly scalable web apps and back-end services using Python, Ruby, Go, and more. Provides DB tools to sync seamlessly with data from SF.

### Salesforce APIs

Lets developers integrate and connect all their enterprise data, networks, and identity info.

### Mobile SDK (software development kit - set of tools provided by the manufacturer of (usually) a hardware platform, operating system (OS), or programming language)

The Mobile SDK is a suite of technologies that lets you build native, HTML5, and hybrid apps that have the same reliability and security as the Salesforce app.
