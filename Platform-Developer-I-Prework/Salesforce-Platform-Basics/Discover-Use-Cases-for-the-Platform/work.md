# Salesforce -> Platform Developer I Prework -> Salesforce Platform Basics -> Discover Use Cases for the Platform

## Learning Objectives

- Describe sample use cases for the platform.
- Discover reasons for using the platform across multiple departments.

## High Impact, Low Effort

Every time you create a custom object, you automatically get something called Chatter feed tracking. Chatter feed tracking provides a way for multiple people to comment and collaborate on a particular record. The discussions and decisions are stored on the record so everyone can stay up to date on important decisions.

As you start building with the platform, keep your eye out for processes with:

- Heavy email collaboration
- Reliance on spreadsheets
- Shared local documents
- Time-intensive, repetitive manual steps
- Impact on only a few departments (you want to minimize the number of stakeholders while you’re still learning)

** Processes with these traits are great candidates for early projects on the Salesforce platform.

## Other Uses for the Platform

### HR - Human Resources

Julian, who works in the DreamHouse HR department, is in crisis. He has hundreds of applications coming in for dozens of job openings. Once applicants are hired, Julian has to set up training and submit hardware requests. All this activity creates a lot of data, and Julian is struggling to manage it all.

D’Angelo to the rescue!

Using the Salesforce platform, D’Angelo can create a custom app that helps DreamHouse’s HR employees streamline and automate the hiring and onboarding process. Here are some things the custom app can do.

- List job openings.
- Store applicants for each job opening.
- Send automated reminders to hiring managers.
- Store orientation and training plans.
- Manage equipment orders.
- Track employee time off.

Like any app built on the platform, the HR app D’Angelo creates is available for the Salesforce mobile app. That way, HR reps can manage applicants and new hires whether reps are in the office or off at a recruiting fair. Cool!

### IT - Information Technology

Over in IT, Regina is also feeling the burn. She’s getting a million IT tickets coming in every minute and everyone’s problems seem to be urgent. Who could she possibly ask for help with this torrent of tickets?

You guessed it. Her friendly neighborhood Salesforce admin, D’Angelo.

When you build your IT ticketing system in the same place as your CRM, you get a lot of benefits. All your users and their information are already there. You can track cases per user and promote collaboration between IT and employees. Here are some other ways to streamline IT using the Salesforce platform:

- Create reports and dashboard to aggregate and analyze requests.
- Send confirmation emails when requests are received, completed, or updated.
- Queue incoming requests.
- Create custom forms for employee requests and create a knowledge base for common issues.
- Track employee hardware assets.

With a streamlined IT process, users are happier and IT has more time to build infrastructure rather than maintain a separate system.
