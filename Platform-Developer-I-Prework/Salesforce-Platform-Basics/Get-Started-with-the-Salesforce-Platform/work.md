#### Getting to Know Our Terms

- ***Object***
- ***Database*** - Think of a giant spreadsheet. When you put info into Salesforce, it gets stored in the database so you can access it again later. it's stored in a very specific way, so you're always accessing the info you need.

  ![DreamHouse App](/Salesforce-Platform-Basics/Get-Started-with-the-Salesforce-Platform/assets/DreamHouse-app.png)
    1) An ***app*** in Salesforce is a set of objects, fields, and other functionality that supports a business process. You can see which app you’re using and switch between apps using the App Launcher ( App Launcher icon).
    2) ***Objects*** are tables in the Salesforce database that store a particular kind of information. There are ***standard objects*** like Accounts and Contacts and ***custom objects*** like the Property object you see in the graphic.
    3) ***Records*** are **rows** in object database tables. Records are the actual data associated with an object. Here, the 211 Charles Street property is a record.
    4) ***Fields*** are **columns** in object database tables. Both standard and custom objects have fields. On our Property object, we have fields like Address and Price.

- ***org*** - Org is short for organization, and it refers to a specific instance of Salesforce. The image here is taken from DreamHouse’s org. Your company can have one or multiple orgs.

## Customizing the Salesforce Platform

You can use the Salesforce platform to develop custom objects and functionality specific to your business without ever writing a line of code.

Developing without code is known as ***declarative development***.

With declarative development, you use forms and drag-and-drop tools ot perform powerful customization tasks.

The Salesforce platform also offers ***programmatic development***, which uses things like "Lightning components." Even if you're not a great programmer, you can still build some amazing things on the Salesforce platform!
