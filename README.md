# salesforce-platform-developer-1

I have decided that I am going to pursue a career in SalesForce development.

Am I scared? Honestly, kind of. What I am scared of is timing, yet I have not acted on my timing issues. I have been lazy, not putting in the work, and have even been physically exhausted from not doing work, somehow. But it follows the same logic behind people who work out vigorously and those who do not work out. The one's putting in more physical work, tend to have more energy, more stamina, and more enthusiasm. Those who do not work out, tend to be lazy, slow, non-energetic, and tired. Unfortunately, that's been me.

With this new direction I have with SalesForce, I am hoping I can turn my life trajectory around and gain an invaluable skill and relearn what it means to learn. I am excited for the possibilities this career path can take me on.

Here we go!
